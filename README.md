# MEGATHON '18: Incompetent Team

This is a repository for the Megathon Team 2018: Incompetent Team. The idea that we present here is a simple protal for startups to recruit interns from the many applications, by collaborating with startups and unversities and provide a simple end-to-end recruitment strategy for interns, who are college students. 

## Motivation
There are two major problem points: a. Students need to enter the internship game, and b. Startups need interns whose selection can be verified in some sense. The combination of these are what we have in our idea, which presents a portal for students, whose projects and achievements which are based on college assignments can be verified. While the current idea focusses on tech startups and tech students, it is easy to see that this is scalable to other branches, streams and places as
well, such as accounting and law interns, who have a mandatory articleship periods.
